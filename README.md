Abstract:
Body fluid identification is an important step in the forensic DNA workflow, and more advanced methods, such as microRNA (miRNA) analysis, have been research topics within the community over the last few decades. We previously reported a reverse-transcription quantitative-PCR (RT-qPCR) panel of eight miRNAs that could classify blood, menstrual secretions, feces, urine, saliva, semen, and vaginal secretions through a differential expression analysis method. The purpose of this project was to evaluate this panel in a larger population size, develop a more statistically robust analysis method and perform a series of developmental validation studies. Each of the eight miRNA markers was analyzed in 50 donors each of blood, menstrual secretions, feces, urine, saliva, semen, and vaginal secretions. A 10-fold cross-validated quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) model yielded the highest classification accuracy of 93% after eliminating miR-1246 and miR-26b from the panel. Accuracy of body fluid predictions was between 84-100% when various population demographics and samples from the same donor over multiple time periods were evaluated. Limit of detection was found to be less than 104 copies/√ÅL in multiple commercially available RT-qPCR analysis methods. These data suggest that miR-200b, miR-10b, miR-320c, and miR-891a, when normalized to let-7g and let-7i, can provide robust, accurate identification of seven biological fluids, further demonstrating the potential of utilizing miRNA analysis in forensic casework.
